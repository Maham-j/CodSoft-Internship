#  Calculator ðŸ§®
 This is a simple command-line calculator program written in Python. It allows users to perform basic arithmetic operations such as addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division on two numbers. The calculator also supports a continuous calculation feature, which means you can perform multiple calculations in succession without restarting the program.
